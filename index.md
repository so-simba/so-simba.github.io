> **SO-SIMBA** â€” Southern Ocean Sea Ice Mass Balance Assessment: a project to quantify Antarctic sea-ice mass balance and advance understanding of its interactions with the ocean.

---

### Background
Antarctic sea ice plays a key role in the Southern Ocean's regional climate and stabilizes Antarctic ice shelves. Unlike the Arctic, it is largely seasonal first-year ice with multiyear ice confined to the western Weddell Sea. Although Arctic ice has declined sharply over past decades, Antarctic extent was stableâ€”or slightly growingâ€”until recent record lows in 2016, 2023, and 2024. Understanding how these changes affect ice thickness is vital for improving models of freshwater fluxes and ocean circulation.

### Objectives
- Develop and validate **novel satellite-based methods** to quantify Antarctic sea ice mass balance.
- **Produce and maintain** a comprehensive Southern Ocean sea ice mass balance dataset derived from Earth observation.
- **Assess freshwater fluxes** between sea ice and the ocean and explore their implications for ocean circulation.
