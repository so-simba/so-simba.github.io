## Background
Antarctic sea ice plays a key role in the Southern Ocean's regional climate and stabilizes Antarctic ice shelves. Unlike the Arctic, it is largely seasonal first‑year ice with multiyear ice confined to the western Weddell Sea. Although Arctic ice has declined sharply over past decades, Antarctic extent was stable—or slightly growing—until recent record lows in 2016, 2023, and 2024. Understanding how these changes affect ice thickness is vital for improving models of freshwater fluxes and ocean circulation.

## Objectives
- Develop and validate **novel satellite-based methods** to quantify Antarctic sea ice mass balance.
- **Produce and maintain** a comprehensive Southern Ocean sea ice mass balance dataset derived from Earth observation.
- **Assess freshwater fluxes** between sea ice and the ocean and explore their implications for ocean circulation.
