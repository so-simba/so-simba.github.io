## Background

Antarctic sea ice is essential for the Southern Ocean's climate and helps shield ice shelves from open-ocean forces. Unlike the Arctic, it consists largely of first-year ice with multiyear ice only in the western Weddell Sea. While Arctic ice has decreased markedly over decades, Antarctic sea ice remained steady—or slightly increased—until recent years, when record lows were seen in 2016, 2023, and 2024. Accurate measurements of sea ice mass, including snow and snow ice, are critical to understanding freshwater fluxes, ocean circulation, and refining climate models.

## Objectives

- **Develop and validate** innovative satellite remote sensing methods to quantify Antarctic sea ice mass balance.
- **Produce and maintain** a comprehensive Earth-observation-derived dataset of Southern Ocean sea ice mass balance.
- **Scientific assessment** of how freshwater fluxes between sea ice and the ocean evolve and affect ocean circulation.
